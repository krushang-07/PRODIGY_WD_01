          <h2>About NFTs</h2>
          <p>
            NFTs, or Non-Fungible Tokens, are unique digital assets that
            represent ownership of a specific item or piece of content. They are
            powered by blockchain technology, ensuring that each NFT is
            one-of-a-kind and cannot be replicated.
          </p>
          <p>
            These tokens can represent anything from digital art and music to
            virtual real estate and collectibles. The unique nature of NFTs
            makes them valuable in the digital economy, providing a new way for
            creators to monetize their work.
          </p>
          <p>
            NFTs are created using smart contracts on blockchain platforms like
            Ethereum. These smart contracts define the unique properties and
            rules of each NFT, including ownership details and transferability.
            Once an NFT is created, it is stored on the blockchain, providing a
            permanent record of ownership.
